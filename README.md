## SchemaTree is a productivity-focused extension for Azure Data Studio.


** This extension was under development, but the nice folks on the ADS team have added the group-by-schema functionality to the app!  This repo is just here for reference now.

Original intent:
Tired of scrolling, scrolling, scrolling to get to the table or stored proc that you want to see? SchemaTree lets you view database objects grouped by schema and/or type then schema.
