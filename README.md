## This is the README for your extension "schematree"

** This extension is under development and it ain't ready yet, so just hold yer horses if you stumbled upon this repo. **
SchemaTree is a productivity-focused extension for Azure Data Studio.

Tired of scrolling, scrolling, scrolling to get to the table or stored proc that you want to see? SchemaTree lets you view database objects grouped by schema and/or type then schema.

You can choose which types of objects to show/hide (does anybody besides DBAs need to see the stuff in "Storage" or "Service Broker"?)

More to come!
